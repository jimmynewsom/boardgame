!!!Right now this code is a mess. I know that. I'm rapidly prototyping a bunch of features, and I'll clean it up later.

Implementation of a role play game using open game content as described in the included Open Gaming License.
practicing OOD and TDD*.

its an interesting project, and there's lots of ways to do it, and I haven't figured out the best one yet.
one good thing about it is I need to implement a logical system that changes and evolves over time, good practice for implementing systems of similarly changing business logic
I plan on gradually tweaking this over time while I work on other things.

one challenge is that DND with humans is infinitely extensible. Like, since people are smart, they can take the rules and add a new rule or an exception to a rule at any time.
kind of like, if we were playing, and we decided "maybe it would be cool if it worked like this", so we change it and make that the rule
its a cool idea for a game, but hard to implement as a program. maybe i should use a different language with first class functions? things to consider


The first version of this will be text based, later versions might use JavaFX and a GUI or Unity.
